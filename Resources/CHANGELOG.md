- Fields beginning with `Pcat` were added to the PERPS table.

## [1.1.0] 2023-03-27

### Added

- Added `country_nongenc_txt` field to the INCIDENTS and PERPS tables. In most cases this value will match `country_genc_txt`. However, there are currently three countries where these values will differ:
    - DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (listed as 'CONGO (KINSHASA)' in GENC)
    - MYANMAR (listed as 'BURMA' in GENC)
    - TÃœRKIYE (listed as 'TURKEY' in GENC)

## [1.0.0] 2022-12-07

### Removed

- Fields beginning with `Pcat` in the PERPS table have been removed. These fields were duplicates of the `Icat` fields in the INCIDENTS table.
